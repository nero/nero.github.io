title: "What others sell to you"
---

Its no secret the western world is an capitalistic society.
This means many things are motivated by monetary gains.
Which sort of turns into, everybody wants to sell you something.
I found it useful to reflect on what companies actually sell you.

Food store?
Nutrition.
This is an obvious example.

Brand clothes?
They sell you a better version of yourself, you with the clothes on, carrying the big names.
This also applies to Apple Products and basically, every major brand tries this (most fail).

Computer security solutions?
They sell safety.
Against fear, like fear of being hacked.
Its no coincidence anti-virus things dont need to actually work as long as they remind the user of their existence.

Charity people in the mall?
They sell conscience.
